This was made under 1.1.1.2. patch. Here u can lvl whatever u like. (EoR, GoE, PS, ST, WD, DW.) If u are lucky with the rolls. U Don't have to put on spirit. As mad_lee mentioned Grava and reaper is ur worst enemy. I maneged to kill 2 reaper, but second time i died. (Need further piloting practice.) Sometimes better to RUN then SPIN away. i don't know why, but sometimes stun or whatever blue, yellow, green, purple effect stop the spining and in that case if u are in danger or whatever just run back a bit and never forget u can still can cast if u don't want to spin. Further EoR works perfectly with ACDTH. Grava + mad queen: The only 2 enemy that u can't facetank and they can ruin ur runs, spin to not die, if they cast u cast to totem win devil. Wendigo totem here is useless. + if u just spin in cricle grava can't nulffication u. Kisen, korvaak: U can facetank each of them (not all at once). The only thing here is if kisen cast the poison thingy spin out of the distance and facetank there. It seems it has a long cooldown to cast it or he won't cast if he know there are 2, but not reching u with them. If u use ascension u can get like 3500 3700 OA in cruci. Big big thx too mad_lee to made his recent vindicator build and sir spanksalot for the video and piloting.

I spent skillpoints to get more stats on the Oathkeeper skillbar with my current set up. Helps a lot get high physique Belgh sigil and 4% spirit shoulders. (don't care too much about the HP, with my current set up i have 18.2k life) Rings
I'm using belgh sigil because have nice att speed bonus and +2 EoR and the Glyph because dps buff, but you can also use the judicator set (Open hand of mercy and closed fist of veangance) for good bonus OA and DA (the damage is really less). Weapon
Well, the weapon is the main problem of the build, because is a MI, but you have 2 options

Segarius' Sacred Blade
Kymon's Santified Blade

prefix: 
Skyfallen
Stormcharged

suffix:
of Celestial wrath
of Fallen Skies
of Flame Caller
of Torrents .

If u run Segarius you will need to change some skill points on the skillbar. Segarius is easy to farm, because his drop is more generous, i was lucky with kymon's father, so i use the one from the grimtools.
There is some options like Mythical Cristallum or Mythical Spark of Ultos (is actually really good) or the Mythical Empyrion's Mercy (prob the best legendary weapon for the build) Amulet
The best dps is the back to glory Mythical Peerless Eye of Beronath, but you can use the Conduit of Wild Whispers with Wind devil bonus(not really necesary) or Conduit of Divine Whispers with Judgment or Ascension bonus.

Pants and Boots
Hard thing of the build, because i'm using GG MIs to get optimal life, resis and stun reduction (the big lack of the build).
Having the stun red problem in mind, you should run Mythical Stormtitan Treads
On pants is really hard, because nothing is better (lightning damage focus) than the Stonehide Solael's, so probably you will run something that fix your resis and defense like Really Great Pants (helps on stats), Mythical Runebrand Legwraps (helps on resis), Mythical Legwraps of the Tranquil Mind (helps on stats and resis) or just the Mythical Chausses of Barbaros if you dont have resis problem and want to go really offensive. >>>Devotions<<<


Tier 1:
Viper
Lizard
Eel
Sailor's Guide
Quill
Hawk
Ghoul -> Any fulltime skill

Tier 2:
Rowhan's Crown -> Vire's Might or Wendigo totem (for SR). Wind Devil with Spears of the Heavens dev set up
Widow -> Judgment or Vire's Might
Behemont -> Any fulltime skill.

Tier 3:
Ultos, Shepherd of Storms -> Eye of Reckoning
One of the next 2 skills
Korvaak, the Eldricht Sun -> Wind Devil (GG procs)
Spear of the Heaven -> Any fulltime skill. (can be better for 1v1 fight, but korvaak skill proc is better debuff) >>>>Game Play<<<< How to play?, simple, just whirlwind everything like a diablo barb... or pretty much. You can have 4 Wind Devils active that last 32 seconds (up to way more if u run Spark of Ultos and/or the Wild Whispers), so you don't need to spam too much if you're fighting a big guy. 
Your main skill and almost the only big source of damage is the Eye of Reckoning, then you just use it all the time and you will see how everything just dissapears on your way (really fast nemesis and bosses kill time, seconds), having really good hp and movility
The MOVILITY is the key word here, and the reason of why this build is GG, because when you're fighting hard guys, you can just hit him meanwhile you try to scape to get back coldowns or health. Also the reason why this build kill and clear that fast, you kill and move at the same time.
That reason is why i use Judgment too, pull enemies and reduce DA to kill they faster (also cancel animations if the monster can bu pulled)

There is some skill choises to survive the bosses on the Shattered Realm, like Ascension(hard guys you need to hit they with this active and scape when is over) and Wendigo totem(this is for facetank, sometimes you need to facetank some bosses to kill they in the split way)

ATM i can facetank Grava up to lv 77-8 evading the nulli shot on the boss stage, after that lv i can't survive very well on the 1v1. same with Rashalga.

Special cares with moosilauke (try to don't get freeze) and Benn'jar, this guy can trap you and that can be rip if hard damage. Kaisan can be a problem too, you can facetank him, but if he summons his pylons, just run away from they.

I use to run the 75 and 76 wave, then get the treasure, is about 10-15 minutes, depends on the boss stage random, sometimes i fail, the important thing is don't fail the 75, if you pass you get the loot, if you pass the 76 in time, you get 2 extra chests. >>>>Crusible<<<<

I did it only 1 time, started at wave 1 up to 170, and repeat the last 20, i recorded the first time from 150 to 170, was under 9 minutes with no issues, second time i got korvaak at the 169, so he survive for the 170 with kuba, reaper, valdaran and iron maiden, had to move a lot, but no big problems, not even close to die.

This build is crusible speed farmer, really safe, really tanky, and all the damage is AoE, that means you can clear really fast all the trash mobs without care about it.

I used Stonewall because i didn't know how good was surviving, next time i'll do vanguard and see the time, maybe will be 7-8 or less. >>>How to Level UP<<<

I lv up this char using the new stone of start at ultimate and doing 5 times the 10 waves of crusible at the begining to get some drop, 17 levels and 5 devotions points. I went to normal and elite to active all the easy and safe shrines that was close to the way points, starting with like 20-25 devs points and lv 24 on ultimate.
Even with that was really hard, i had to drop lokarr set about lv 60, because i was taking too much damage. But if you don't have all that i used to level up, i'll explain a short guide about how to do it in the normal way.

Skill path:
Go into oathkeeper giving 1 point of everything you wanna use to kill mobs until you can get eye of reckoning. That should be about lv 15-20. On lv 10 you can go into shaman and get the mogdrogen pact, spend a couple points here. Try to put points on the EoR just to see you kill fast enough with it and try to complete the oeathkeepe skill bar to get divine mandate. Get points on jugdment, vire might and ascension as helping skills, presense of virtue and mogdrogen pact try to max it (energy regeneration to get infinite EoR) then you can max the EoR. Before the main skill, max the Soulfire. You can put some points on the guardian of Empyrion and his Secondary for more debuff)
At this point your build is Fire physical.
After lv 60 you can start going for lightning bonus (you might be getting ultos at this point, below the dev path), put more points on shaman for wind devils secondary debuff. Helps on your lightning and fire damage.
The last lvs until you can use your end gear is always hard for new players, but this skill have lot of damage, try to get a good damage weapon and you will crash enemies.

As advice, try to lv up using a shield, you will tank a way more and is better than caster offhand on oathkeeper.

Once you hit lv 94 you can get back all the fire-phys skills focused and even get back the oathkeeper skillbar and go for end shaman to get the Stormcaller's Pact


Devotions path:
Go first for ghoul. then make the way to go for Ultos, this is viper, eel, quill, rowhan's crow(you dev proc for the first lvs) hawk, behemont then ultos.
After you get the Ultos, go for widow, lizard, Sailor's guide (maybe you will need to get some of this blue devs for ultos early) then Spear or Korvaak. If you didn't hit lv94, Korvaak is really good, once you are 94 you can choose any between.

In my opinion this build have too much damage, you can kill really fast anything on the campain mode, any nemesis (grava always need to be tricky to play it if you're melee) almost facetank, and kill Rashalga on facetank mode too.
Is really fast farm build, but can be hard to learn it for tank players, because the way to kill some hard enemies is not just stay and kill, sometimes is all about positions, that is why you run teleport rune and low coldown vire's might.



Final words
If you don't like judgment, is not mandatory on the build, i like it a lot because is a tool of control of density. If you want a build to tank everything and don't move too much, this is not the set that you need to use if you want to EoR.
If you want to do more damage to farm lower levels of the SR, you can always drop some defensives components, like seal of blades get more points into Clarity of purpose instead of Ascension.";Sa10;Eye of Reckoning;https://www.grimtools.com/calc/O2GXqMlV;Shattered Realms/Crucible;If you don't like judgment, is not mandatory on the build
