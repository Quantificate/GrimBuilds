If you would like to help, submit a pull request for the reactboot branch. I'll keep this updated as closely as possible to what I'm working on, and I'll let you know if I'm actively changing something on it when you submit the request.

Update 4/29: Added JSON file for character builds, changed card displays to use the JSON data. Added Express server to the backend to serve the JSON to React.

Update 4/28: Added basic layout for the browse directory using React and React-Bootstrap. Functionality is coming soon.

rebuild02 is the active working directory.

static, templates, and main.py are all the quick mockup I did in flask.
